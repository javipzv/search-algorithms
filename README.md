## Search Algorithms (Dijkstra and A*)

This project includes an interactive visualization application for two of the most well-known pathfinding algorithms: Dijkstra and A*. The repository contains the implementation of both algorithms, along with the graph class, and real city graphs are loaded using the OpenStreetMap library. For the user interface and visualization, the pygame library is used. Through the visualization, you can explore the key differences between the algorithms, especially in how they select nodes to visit.

### Features
- City Selection: Choose between Madrid or Barcelona.
- Algorithms: Visualize Dijkstra and A* in action.
- Interactive: Select start and end points manually on the map.

### Running the project
- Clone the repository.
- Install the dependencies.
- Run app.py.
