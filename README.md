## Search Algorithms (Dijkstra and A*)

This project includes an interactive visualization application for two of the most well-known pathfinding algorithms: Dijkstra and A*. The repository also contains the implementation of the graph class, and real city graphs have been loaded using the OpenStreetMap library. Through this visualization, you can discover the key differences between the two algorithms, particularly how they select the nodes to visit.

### Features
- City Selection: Choose between Madrid or Barcelona.
- Algorithms: Visualize Dijkstra and A* in action.
- Interactive: Select start and end points manually on the map.

### Running the project
Clone the repository.
Install the dependencies.
